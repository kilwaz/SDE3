     * actions against Selenium can cause the WebDriver to run close and keystore overloaded.  Previously it was causing
     * issues with the number of ports on the local machine.  Selenium uses local ports to connect to the WebDriver
     * browser and requesting too much too fast exhausts the current ports that are available.

     * Using JSoup for all lookups and checking the page speeds up the code and drastically and reduces the amount of work
     * we are doing in Selenium.
